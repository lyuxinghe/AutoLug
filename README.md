# Auto-following Luggage Platform

## Description

This project describes a smart luggage platform that can identify its owner through QR code and automatically follow him or her, therefore not requiring any effort from the owner to carry the luggage around while traveling. The complete description can be found [here](./AutoLug_Paper.pdf).

AutoLug can be controlled through its mobile APP. The user interface allows the user to monitor the vehicle's speed, set the maximum allowed safety speed, steer the vehicle's orientation, and control the vehicle's speed.

AutoLug can also work in autonomous tracking mode. Users can register themselves through QR code and attach their printed QR code to their back. AutoLug will decode the detected QR codes and start traking the correct owner.
